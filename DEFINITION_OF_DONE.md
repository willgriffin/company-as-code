Now I have the content that the user wants to format into proper markdown. The content appears to be a Definition of Done document with various sections and checkboxes. I'll format this into proper markdown with:

1. Proper headings using # syntax
2. Proper checkbox formatting with [ ] 
3. Clear section breaks
4. Consistent formatting throughout

Since I'm in Ask mode, I can't directly write to the file, but I can provide the formatted markdown that the user can then copy and paste into their file.
